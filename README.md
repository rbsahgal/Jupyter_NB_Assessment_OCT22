# Jupyter_NB_Assessment_OCT22
# Jupyter NB for Assessment_Oct22 Programming assessment This repo contains some basic python and tensorflow exercises for practise It also contains a basic image classification task implemented in python/tensorflow

Please note: image_classification_assignment notebook file is the official assignment check-in file
the pdf file is a "print" copy of the same session.
1. Split data into train, validation and test sets
2. Create a custom CNN model.
3. Data augmentation
	Randomizing contrast
	Randomizing brightness
	Randomizing rotation - trying to make it invariant to rotation
4. Used regularization
	Dropout
	Data augmentation
	Scheduled Learning Rate
5. Saved model to local computer and committed to repository

6. Have used code snippets from https://www.tensorflow.org/ tutorials/documentation. Hope it's considered an open book approach and not plagiarism.
	

image_classification_transfer_learning is an alternate approach I would like to demonstrate if considered ok. currently this file is incomplete
